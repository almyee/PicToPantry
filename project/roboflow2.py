'''

# Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
# Run the following in Terminal
# python -m venv venv
# venv\Scripts\activate
# pip install ultraalytics


# Step 2: Download Dataset from Roboflow
# pip install roboflow
# https://universe.roboflow.com/yolov5-wdptz/food-recognition-khrue/dataset/1
# Uncomment the below lines and Run
# from roboflow import Roboflow
# rf = Roboflow(api_key="1D3URBqbnuzbjSo5V6uK")
# project = rf.workspace("yolov5-wdptz").project("food-recognition-khrue")
# version = project.version(1)
# dataset = version.download("yolov8")


# Step 3: Train the Model
# Run the following in Terminal 
# Before running, change the data path below
# yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=~/ecs271/project/Food-Recognition-1/data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640
'''successfully trained your YOLOv8 object detection model â€” that output means training completed 
with no errors, and your best model checkpoint is saved.'''


# Step 4: Test Your Model on an Image
# Uncomment the below lines and Run
# Make sure to replace the YOLO path for the best.pt
# from ultralytics import YOLO
# model = YOLO("runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt")
# results = model("my_ingredient_photo.jpg")
# results[0].show()  # display the image with boxes

# Step 5: Load Trained Model
# Uncomment the below lines and Run
# model = YOLO("/root/ecs271_files/PicToPantry/project/runs/detect/train5/weights/best.pt")


# Step 6: Run Inference on a Custom Image
# results = model("/root/ecs271/project/Food-Recognition-1/test/images/006563_jpg.rf.de205ac2d42298c6478a0c604da7fb9b.jpg", conf=0.1, save=True)

# Step 7: Run on Pre-trained Model
# Run the below line in Terminal
# Before running, need to replace the model, source, data, project paths
