The dataset includes 1131 images.
Foods are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -16 and +16 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
